/**
 * <[bold]>COURSEWORK<[/bold]>
 * - <[bold]>Fundamentals of Computer Science 1<[/bold]>: Introduces systematic program design, basic data modeling, and
 *   rigorous testing through incremental programming problems.
 * - <[bold]>Fundamentals of Computer Science 2<[/bold]>: Introduces object-oriented design and abstraction with larger,
 *   modular projects that emphasize readability and reuse.
 * - <[bold]>Object-Oriented Design<[/bold]>: Applies encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism plus common design
 *   patterns and unit testing to build maintainable codebases.
 * - <[bold]>Algorithms and Data<[/bold]>: Studies asymptotic analysis and core data structures (lists, trees, heaps,
 *   graphs) to implement and evaluate efficient algorithms.
 * - <[bold]>Discrete Structures<[/bold]>: Develops proof techniques and discrete math foundations including sets,
 *   relations, graphs, combinatorics, and induction.
 * - <[bold]>Logic and Computation<[/bold]>: Covers propositional and predicate logic, formal specification, and reasoning
 *   about program correctness.
 * - <[bold]>Database Design<[/bold]>: Designs relational schemas, normalizes data, and uses SQL for queries, transactions,
 *   and integrity constraints.
 * - <[bold]>Computer Systems<[/bold]>: Explores how programs execute—from memory and processes to concurrency and
 *   low-level systems programming concepts.
 * - <[bold]>Theory of Computation<[/bold]>: Examines automata and formal languages, Turing machines, decidability and
 *   reductions, and core complexity classes (P, NP, NP-complete) to understand computation’s limits.
 * - <[bold]>Fundamentals of Cybersecurity<[/bold]>: Introduces core security principles, common threat models, and
 *   defenses across cryptography, networks, and application security.
